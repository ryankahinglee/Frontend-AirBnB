UI/UX Document

The app we've created focused heavily on enabling users to understand and use our app with no prior experience via a minimalistic design. It makes use of UI/UX fundamentals such as familiar UI patterns (position of Navigation Bar and Login/Logout buttons) and consistency across pages (color scheme, font-family, font-size). Overall, the app appeals towards both first-time users and users with experience with similar apps such as AirBnb.

Features to improve UI/UX
Our app uses a basic color scheme of blue, with the following colors:
- #4073CC (Button)
- #6392e3 (Border of Listings)
- #286ee6 (Detail Title of Listing properties)
Where all three colors share a color palette and are harmonious to one another, users are able to focus on functionality rather than being distracted by excessive aesthetics/UI

Images are also comply with accessibility with alt-text to allow screen readers to function should the image not be rendered properly.

Buttons have 'hover' properties to allow users to determine whether they are clickable or not. 

Font-family is Roboto across entire app to ensure consistency, with font-size varying for headers.

Warnings/Alerts are used to provide feedback to users on input (For example, an alert will appear when a successful booking is made). This is done to provide assurance to users that the app 
responds to its functions. Additionally, a 'Confirm deletion' modal is used for users in case a user accidentally presses the 'delete' button for a listing. As there is no undo button, 
it provides safety and prevents mistakes/accidents from occuring. 

The layout of the screen focuses on a 'mobile-first design' such that mobile users are able to view the app without any functions. For laptop/computer users, the function works in the same way, but provides more spacing between elements. Listings are layered row by row to allow users to view multiple listings at once, with forms/create pages centered. The navigation bar is placed at the top of each page to allow users to navigate at ease.
